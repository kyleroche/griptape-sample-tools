[![Deploy_to_Griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-cloud/assets/2302515/4fd57873-5c93-44a8-8fa3-ac1bf7d73bcc)](https://cloud.griptape.ai/tools/create/datetime)

Based on the framework [DateTimeTool](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/blob/main/griptape/tools/date_time/tool.py).

This Tool can be used to return current date and time. Access to the current date and time allows a language model to provide timely and relevant information, schedule tasks, manage time-sensitive queries, and enhance user interactions by aligning responses with real-world contexts.
