Based on the framework [DateTimeTool](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/blob/main/griptape/tools/date_time/tool.py).

This Tool can be used to return current date and time. Access to the current date and time allows a language model to provide timely and relevant information, schedule tasks, manage time-sensitive queries, and enhance user interactions by aligning responses with real-world contexts.
